This is the second practice of Software Development, where we will focus on using PyBuilder.



Create repository.
venv
Add PyBuilder pip install pybuilder


pyb --start-project (everything default)

no pylint this time!

pyb executes pybuild



pyb --no-venvs
this command Works waaay better than pyb --no-venvs



unitest
